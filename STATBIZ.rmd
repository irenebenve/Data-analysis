# Data-analysis
### LOW DIMENSIONAL MODEL ANALYSIS
This analysis aims to investigate the impact of "International Plan" and "Total Day Minutes" on customer churn using logistic regression models. The models are trained on different datasets (normal, undersampled, and oversampled) to address class imbalance and compare the results.

Effect of Total Day Minutes and International Plan across all models, having an international plan significantly impacts the probability of churn. The interaction term indicates that the effect of total day minutes on churn probability varies based on whether the customer has an international plan.
The model trained on the original data (unbalanced) may suffer from class imbalance, potentially leading to biased predictions towards the majority class. 
PLOT
COMMENT

The undersampled model aims to provide a balanced view but might discard important information due to reduced data size.
PLOT
COMMENT

The oversampled model attempts to balance the classes by increasing the minority instances, which can improve the model's ability to predict churn for the minority class but may also introduce overfitting.
PLOT
COMMENT

The predicted probabilities from the plots reveal the relationship between total day minutes and churn probability, moderated by the international plan. Customers with an international plan show a different churn probability pattern compared to those without it.
PLOT
COMMENT

This analysis highlights the importance of balancing datasets when building predictive models, especially in the presence of class imbalance. The interaction between total day minutes and the international plan provides valuable insights into customer churn behavior. Future steps could involve testing additional variables, using more advanced balancing techniques, and evaluating model performance using metrics like ROC-AUC and confusion matrices.
By comparing the models, we can see the trade-offs between different sampling strategies and their impact on the predictive performance. The visualizations help communicate these effects clearly, aiding in the understanding and interpretation of the logistic regression results.


### LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE CALLS 
Goal of the Analysis: This analysis aims to evaluate the impact of "Customer Service Calls" on customer churn using logistic regression models. The models are trained on different datasets (normal, undersampled, and oversampled) to address class imbalance and compare the results.

The number of customer service calls significantly impacts the probability of churn. As the number of customer service calls increases, the likelihood of churn also increases across all models.
The model trained on the original data (unbalanced) may be biased towards the majority class, potentially leading to underestimation of churn probability for the minority class.


The undersampled model addresses class imbalance by reducing the majority class instances, providing a more balanced view but possibly discarding some important information.
PLOT
COMMENT

The oversampled model balances the classes by increasing the minority instances, which can improve the model's ability to predict churn for the minority class but may also introduce overfitting.
PLOT
COMMENT

The predicted probabilities from the plots reveal a clear relationship between the number of customer service calls and churn probability. More customer service calls correspond to higher churn probabilities.


This analysis highlights the importance of balancing datasets when building predictive models, especially in the presence of class imbalance. The number of customer service calls is a strong predictor of customer churn. Future steps could involve testing additional variables, using more advanced balancing techniques, and evaluating model performance using metrics like ROC-AUC and confusion matrices.
By comparing the models, we can see the trade-offs between different sampling strategies and their impact on the predictive performance. The visualizations help communicate these effects clearly, aiding in the understanding and interpretation of the logistic regression results.






### CLASSIFICATION TREE
Goal of the Analysis: This analysis aims to evaluate the impact of "Total Day Minutes," "International Plan," and "Customer Service Calls" on customer churn using classification tree models. The models are trained on different datasets (normal, undersampled, and oversampled) to address class imbalance and compare the results.

### Classification Tree with Normal Data
- The aim is to build a classification tree using the normal training dataset to predict customer churn based on "Total Day Minutes," "International Plan," and "Customer Service Calls." The tree structure is visualized to show decision rules, and a complexity parameter table is printed to assess model pruning. Variable importance is calculated to identify key predictors, and a confusion matrix is generated to evaluate model performance.
   ```r
   predictions_tree = predict(simple_tree, train_data, type = "class")
   confusion_matrix_tree = table(predictions_tree, train_data$Churn)
   print(confusion_matrix_tree)
   ```

#### Classification Tree with Undersampled Data
- the objective is to build a classification tree using undersampled data, which balances the classes by reducing the number of non-churn observations.
- The output is similar to the normal data model, the tree structure is visualized, complexity parameter table printed, variable importance calculated, and confusion matrix generated for model evaluation using the undersampled dataset.
**Plotting the Tree:**
   ```r
   rpart.plot(simple_tree_undersample, main = "Classification Tree - Undersample Data")
   ```
 **Confusion Matrix:**
   ```r
   predictions_tree_undersample = predict(simple_tree_undersample, train_data_undersample, type = "class")
   confusion_matrix_tree_undersample = table(predictions_tree_undersample, train_data_undersample$Churn)
   print(confusion_matrix_tree_undersample)
   ```


#### Classification Tree with Oversampled Data
- The goal is to build a classification tree using oversampled data, which balances the classes by increasing the number of churn observations.
- The tree structure is visualized for the oversampled dataset, complexity parameter table printed, variable importance calculated, and confusion matrix generated to evaluate model performance.
 **Complexity Parameter Table:**
   ```r
   printcp(simple_tree_oversample)
   ```
 **Variable Importance:**
   ```r
   importance_oversample = varImp(simple_tree_oversample, scale = FALSE)
   print(importance_oversample)
   ```
 **Confusion Matrix:**
   ```r
   predictions_tree_oversample = predict(simple_tree_oversample, train_data_oversample, type = "class")
   confusion_matrix_tree_oversample = table(predictions_tree_oversample, train_data_oversample$Churn)
   print(confusion_matrix_tree_oversample)
   ```

This detailed analysis of classification tree models trained with "Total Day Minutes," "International Plan," and "Customer Service Calls" demonstrates the significance of these variables in predicting customer churn. By comparing models trained on normal, undersampled, and oversampled datasets, the analysis evaluates the impact of data balancing techniques on model performance. The visualizations and evaluation metrics provide clear insights into how the classification tree models handle different data balancing approaches.
